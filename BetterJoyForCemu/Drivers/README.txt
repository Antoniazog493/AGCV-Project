Note: HidGuardian has been removed from BetterJoy as it is outdated and no longer maintained.
For hiding controllers from other applications, BetterJoy now uses HidHide, a modern and actively maintained alternative.

Download HidHide from: https://github.com/nefarius/HidHide/releases
HidHide is optional but recommended for improved compatibility with other programs (like Steam).
BetterJoy will automatically detect and use HidHide if it's installed on your system.
